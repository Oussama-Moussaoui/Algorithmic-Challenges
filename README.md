# Algorithmic-Challenges
In this repository, I'll be sharing some algorithms that I solved throughout my learning journey!

# How I organized this repository: 
First, you'll find 3 folders (easy, medium, difficult), each one contains problems of the same difficulty. For every algorithm, there will 2 files:

2- .md file that contains DESCRIPTION, SOURCE and DIFFICULTY of that algorithm;

3- The actual code I wrote as a solution algoName.js/.py/.c/...
